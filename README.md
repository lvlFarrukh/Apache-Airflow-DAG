# Server Logs ETL with Apache Airflow

## Project Description

This project is an example of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process implemented as an Apache Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to:

1. **Extract** server log data from a log file.
2. **Transform** the extracted data by extracting useful information and performing necessary transformations.
3. **Load** the transformed data into another file.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following key components:

- **ETL_Server_Access_Log_Processing.py**: This is the Apache Airflow DAG script that defines the ETL workflow. It orchestrates the ETL process by specifying tasks for extraction, transformation, and loading.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/): Ensure that you have Apache Airflow set up and configured on your system.

## Usage
